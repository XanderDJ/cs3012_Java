# cs3012_Java
##Introduction
I'm Xander De Jaegere a student of the module CS3012.
My implementation of LCA for a binary tree and a DAG will be made here.
I'm implementing this in Java so if I'm not able to set up and learn haskell in time.
I can still show that i know the process of engineering and have followed it here.

# cs3012_Java
##Introduction
I'm Xander De Jaegere a student of the module CS3012.
My implementation of LCA for a binary tree and a DAG will be made here.
I'm implementing this in Java so if I'm not able to set up and learn haskell in time.
I can still show that i know the process of engineering and have followed it here.

##DONE
1) Made node implementation with callback to pointer
1) adding an new child to a node will make a balanced binary tree from that node onward
1) LCA in a binary tree will work with good inputs (child is part of the tree and is unique)
##TODO
1) first write test cases for everything
1) Refactor my code so that binary tree is it own object that extends Node. so that set Child will make a balanced tree for a binary tree
but you can still use a Node object for DAH. at the moment setChild is defined at Node and this shouldn't be
1) implement multiple parent philosophy for Node. 
1) implement LCA for both graphs.

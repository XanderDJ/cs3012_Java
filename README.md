# cs3012_Java
##Introduction
I'm Xander De Jaegere a student of the module CS3012.
My implementation of LCA for a binary tree and a DAG will be made here.
I'm implementing this in Java so if I'm not able to set up and learn haskell in time.
I can still show that i know the process of engineering and have followed it here.

##DONE
1) Made node implementation with callback to pointer
1) adding an new child to a node will make a balanced binary tree from that node onward
1) LCA in a binary tree will work with good inputs (child is part of the tree and is unique)
##TODO
1) Test the program for weird inputs and make sure errors are thrown
2) rearrange code to make objects more consistent

# cs3012_Java
## Introduction
I'm Xander De Jaegere a student of the module CS3012.
My implementation of LCA for a binary tree and a DAG will be made here.
I'm implementing this in Java so if I'm not able to set up and learn haskell in time.
I can still show that i know the process of engineering and have followed it here.

## DONE
1) Made node implementation with callback to pointer
1) adding an new child to a node will make a balanced binary tree from that node onward
1) LCA in a binary tree will work with good inputs (child is part of the tree and is unique)
1) LCA works for every non cyclic Graph. A cyclic graph will put the algorithm in an infinite loop
## TODO
1) deal with wrong inputs
